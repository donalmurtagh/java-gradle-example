# java-tech-test

To build the project and run the tests, execute the following on the command-line from the project root dir

```
./gradlew clean test
```

If running on Windows, use the following instead 

```
gradlew clean test
```

The only dependency is JDK 8 (Gradle will be downloaded and installed, if a suitable version cannot be found).
